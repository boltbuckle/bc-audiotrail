[Librivox](http://librivox.org/the-art-of-war-by-sun-tzu/) recording of The Art of War by Sun Tzu, translated by Lionel Giles. Read by Moira Fogarty. "The Art of War is a Chinese military treatise written during the 6th  century BC by Sun Tzu. Composed of 13 chapters, each of which is devoted to one aspect of warfare, it has long been praised as the definitive  work on military strategies and tactics of its time. The Art of War is  one of the oldest and most famous studies of strategy and has had a huge influence on both military planning and beyond. The Art of War has also been applied, with much success, to business and managerial  strategies."
